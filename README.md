TV Table Rack
=============

This repo contains a model a small 3D-printed computer rack for all the tiny
electronics that is installed under my TV table. It's a test project designed
using [GhostSCAD][ghscad] - a system capable generating OpenSCAD models in Go.
I wrote a [blog post][bp] describing some of the motivations.
